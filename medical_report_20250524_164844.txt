In this exercise, we created a function that generates a comprehensive radiological report based on the tumor detection results. The report includes a summary of the findings, a detailed description of each detected tumor, potential clinical implications, recommendations for further tests or treatment, and a comparison with typical characteristics of each tumor type.
